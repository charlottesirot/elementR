Title: An Framework for Reducing Elemental LAICPMS Data from Solid
        Structures
Version: 1.3.8

Description: Aims to facilitate the reduction of elemental microchemistry data from solid-phase LAICPMS analysis (laser ablation inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry). The 'elementR' package provides a reactive and user friendly interface (based on a 'shiny' application) and a set of 'R6' classes for conducting all steps needed for an optimal data reduction while leaving maximum control for user.
